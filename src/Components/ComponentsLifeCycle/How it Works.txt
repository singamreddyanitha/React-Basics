Component Life Cycle 

NOTE : For every change in the state, render method is called and render method updates the UI

Every React Component goes through three phases throughout its lifetime:

Mounting Phase
Updating Phase
Unmounting phase


Mounting Phase 

1) State Initialization (constructor)
2) render which will return A JSX 
3) ComponentDidMount() this is used to set timers/API calls initialy when the page is rendered 

updating phase 

1) render

the data which is fetched in ComponentDidMount gets fetched 
so the fetched data is either stored in the state/constructor 
so as the state is updated, render method needs to be called and New JSX will be returned
so the ui will get updated 


unmounting phase

This phase, the timers what we set needs to be cleared,
it's not manditory but most prefered to clear/umount the phase 
we need to do it to increase the performance of the apllication and remove the warings during the deployment stage 

For this there is a method : ComponentWillUnmount()
using this we can unmount the pahse

Not only these there are  many life cycle methods,
shouldComponentupdate,componentDidCatch etc all are used based on the required Which we develop our application
