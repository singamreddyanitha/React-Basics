Component Life Cycle 


Every React Component goes through three phases throughout its lifetime:

Mounting Phase
Updating Phase
Unmounting phase

In Functional components, there are no life cycle methods 

to use life cycle methods in functionl components, react hooks provided us with a new Hook named as useEffects Hook 

this useEffect Hook acts both as ComponentDidMount and ComponentWillUnmount
